1. What is the function of the following technologies in your assignment:
i. HTML : Provides general structure and elements of the webpage. Functions as the backbone.
ii. CSS : Makes it easier to stylize elements within HTML by grouping elemnts with similar personalities together.
iii. JavaScript : Makes the HTML page user-interactive. Especially the comment section  in blogs and the contact us form in the contact us page.
iv. Python : It activates the server.
v. Flask : It's sort of a Python library that helps Python to function as a server
vi. HTTP : Acts as a bridge between the server and the webpage to process requests, etc.
vii. GET and POST requests : Literally getting information from and posting information to the server.

2. How does HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together in the browser for this assignment?
To use a methphor, HTML is the human body, CSS is the clothes it is wearing, and JavaScript is how the body interacts with others. All parts are equally necessary in effective human communication.

3. How does Python and Flask work together in the server for this assignment?
There is nothing special about Python alone. We could have chosen another language to serve as a server; Python is a mere language that we chose to write the server script in. However, when paried with Flask, which is a Python framework that enbales it to handle requests and stuff, Python turns into a powerful monster that we want it to be.

4. List all of the possible GET and POST requests that your server returns a response for and describes what happens for each GET and POST request
GET requests are happening everywhere. When we click a link to another page or refresh the current page.
POST requests take place when we submit something to the web server. When we send an email via contact us page, it is sending a POST request.
